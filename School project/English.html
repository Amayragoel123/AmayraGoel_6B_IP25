<td align="center"><h2>Once there was a cry heard in a small room in Moti Vavdi village, Bhavnagar, Gujarat .A little girl named Ila sachani was born. She was born into a farming family. Despite being born with her hands she could not use conventionally, she was determined to overcome her challenges. Her mother and grandmother, skilled in Kathiawar embroidery, taught her to create stunning patterns using her feet.<hr></hr>

Initially, threading a needle was a very difficult task for Ila, but with unwavering determination, she became an expert at a young age. She also learned various styles like Kachhi, Kashmiri, and Lucknawi.</h2></td>
