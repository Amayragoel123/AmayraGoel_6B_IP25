NAVIC=

The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite 
System (IRNSS) aka NavIC (Navigation with 
Indian Constellation) is a group of 7 satellites 
developed by ISRO. This system provides a 
Global Positioning System (GPS) service in 
India. It provides real-time positioning and 
timing services. The system covers areas from 
India extending up to 1500 kms and is 
expected to reach more areas in the future.
Well, NavIC provides us with various services 
such as Standard Positioning Service (SPS) 
for civilian use, Restricted Services (RS) for 
authorized users like defense forces, and a 
Search and Search and Rescue service.
A Fun Fact:- The word NavIC is derived from 
the Sanskrit word Navik, which means sailor 
or navigator.</li></ul>

About the Navigation with Indian 
Constellation (NaVIC)
Coverage Area: The IRNSS-NavIC system 
is designed to provide precise position 
information within India and an area up to 
1,500 km beyond its borders, which is 
designated as the primary service area. 
IRNSS Services: IRNSS offers two primary 
services:
Standard Positioning Service (SPS) 
Restricted Service (RS)
National Security and Strategic 
Independence
Relying solely on foreign satellite 
navigation systems, like the U.S. GPS, 
poses potential security risks, as 
access can be restricted or degraded 
during critical situations
Enhanced Navigation Accuracy in the 
Region
NavIC is specifically designed for India 
and surrounding areas, offering 
enhanced positioning accuracy 
tailored to the regional needs of South 
Asia. With an expected accuracy of 
better than 20 meters within its 
primary coverage area.
Support for Civilian Applications
NavIC supports a range of civilian 
applications, such as transportation, 
agriculture, disaster management, and 
marine navigation. 
Disaster Management and Emergency 
Response
NavIC’s reliable navigation services 
help during natural disasters by 
improving coordination in emergency 
response efforts. With location 
accuracy and continuous coverage.
Interoperability with Global Systems
NavIC’s compatibility with other global 
navigation systems (GPS, GLONASS, 
Galileo, BeiDou) enhances its 
usefulness and broadens its range of 
applications.</P></th></ul>

This article is about the Indian telecommunications and broadcasting satellites. For the navigation satellites, see Galileo navigation system. For the algorithm for propositional Boolean satisfiability, see WalkSAT. For the Taiwanese university entrance exam, see General Scholastic Ability Test.
Not to be confused with G Sat, a Philippine satellite television provider.
The GSAT (Geosynchronous Satellite)[1] satellites are India's indigenously developed communications satellites, used for digital audio, data and video broadcasting. As of 5 December 2018, 20 GSAT satellites manufactured by ISRO have been launched, out of which 14 are in service

The GSAT series of geosynchronous satellites is a system developed by ISRO with an objective to make India self-reliant in broadcasting services. The system includes a total of 168 transponders (out of which 95 are leased out to provide services to broadcasters) in the C, Extended C and Ku bands, providing services to telecommunications, television broadcasting, weather forecasting, disaster warning and search and rescue operations.

Applications of GSAT Satellite
1) Communication Services
•	GSAT satellites are primarily designed for providing communication services, including voice, data, and video transmission, catering to the needs of telecommunication operators and service providers.
2) Internet Connectivity
•	GSAT supports satellite-based internet services, bridging the digital divide by providing connectivity to rural and remote areas where terrestrial networks may not be available.
3) Broadband Services
•	GSAT satellites offer broadband connectivity, enhancing internet speeds and accessibility, especially in regions lacking high-speed terrestrial connectivity.
4) E-Governance
•	GSAT facilitates e-governance initiatives by enabling connectivity to government offices, helping in efficient service delivery and citizen engagement.
5) Rural Connectivity
•	GSAT plays a vital role in connecting remote and rural areas, empowering communities with access to information, education, and essential services.
6) Tele-Education
•	GSAT supports tele-education initiatives by transmitting educational content to schools and institutions in distant regions, promoting remote learning and skill development.
7) Digital Services
•	GSAT enables various digital services, including digital broadcasting, digital libraries, and digital content distribution, 
•	
•	8) Mobile Connectivity
•	GSAT satellites complement terrestrial mobile networks by providing mobile backhaul services, 
9) Remote Sensing and Earth Observation
•	Some GSAT satellites carry payloads for remote sensing and earth observation applications.
10) Military Communication
•	In addition to civilian applications, GSAT satellites are also used for military communication and strategic purposes.</p></th>
